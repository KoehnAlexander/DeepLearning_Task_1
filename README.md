# DeepLearning_Task_1

Welcome to my software contribution.

I worked on both tasks. Task 1 was my main goal and I tried my best. I worked on Task 2 to learn a bit more. So there might be some interesting things, too.

## Binder to Task 1
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/KoehnAlexander/DeepLearning_Task_1/HEAD)


This project was developed in pycharm. I tested it on binder and it has worked there.

I only used the normal packages, so I think it should work on any workstation.


My final report is included in the task 1 over the code in different section, in my opinion this makes it more understandable.

The comments to the Tutorials are in this repo, too.
