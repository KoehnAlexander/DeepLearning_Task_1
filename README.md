# DeepLearning_Task_1

Welcome to my software contribution.

I worked on both tasks. Task 1 was my main goal and I tried my best. I worked on Task 2 to learn a bit more. So there might be some interesting things, too.

## Binder to Task 1

This project was developed in pycharm.

The requirements.txt consists of the requirements for task 1.

I only used the normal packages, so I think it should function on any workstation.


My final report is included in the task 1 over the code in different section, but in my opininion this makes it more understandable.

The comments to the Tutorials are in this repo, too
